# Basic bot made in Rust
### Setup:
1. Make a `secrets.rs` file in the `src/` directory.
2. Add the following:
```rs
pub const BOT_TOKEN: &str = "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE";
pub const AI_TOKEN: &str = "GEMINI_BOT_TOKEN_HERE";
```
3. Replace the placeholders with your own tokens.
4. Run `cargo run` in the main directory.
